# Azure Studies Presentations

Greetings Folks!

I've started my journey on Microsoft Azure Developer Certification, and accepted a friend's suggestion of prepare talks and demos about the topics I was studying in order to check the knowledge gained and also give share it with others.

This repo will contain a serie of projects that I'll create and push with the realted link to article in this README, where the topics are covered.

I hope that just like me, you'll be able to open your mind and start this journey.
